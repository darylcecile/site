snippet: Moving out of Nottingham
---

This post has been a long time in the making. I've been scratching my head, wondering how to announce this
major milestone in my life. When writing notes for my website, I often like to form a story to help me get my thought process across; 
but the thing is, this doesn't need a story because it is already a story on its own. And after many unsuccessful attempts at starting this
post, I'll cut straight to the chase; I'm moving back to London.

This decision had been settled for a while now, and when I first announced it to my closest, everyone was somewhat shocked but supportive. After
spending 6+ years in Nottingham, I feel like it is finally time to move on and move out. I've made so many memories along the way, met so many
amazing people, forged new connections, made life-long friends, shared some amazing experiences 
(see [PF](https://projectfunction.io/notes/this-isnt-farewell)), and was welcomed into great communities like the 
[NTU Pride Society](https://twitter.com/NTUPrideSociety), and [Tech Nottingham](https://twitter.com/technottingham). These are the ones I will
cherish forever; they have helped me discover who I am, and have helped shape who I want to be and what I want to achieve. 💕

As some of you may know, I moved to Nottingham a little over 6 years ago for University; I did a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Since then
I made great new friends, co-founded an amazing community-driven company called <Abbr link="https://projectfunction.io">ProjectFunction</Abbr>, and
made Nottingham my home. After leaving <Abbr link="https://ntu.ac.uk" static=true title="Nottingham Trent University">NTU</Abbr>, I went straight into work, working for a clinical trial company,
then a local web agency before moving to my current Job as a Software Development Engineer at CapitalOne. I've learned a lot along the way but
eventually started wondering whether there was more to it. As much as I love Notts, I ended up outgrowing it. Covid didn't help; a lot of the places I
enjoyed frequenting have either closed down (looking at 
you [Propaganda](https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/music-nightlife/end-era-nottingham-nightclub-closes-4140415)), or changed 
[beyond recognition](https://newforestersnottingham.co.uk/). I needed space to stretch. London was the ideal next candidate having grown up there and
having family based there. I just needed one more reason to make the life-changing move.

Last week, my partner started a new job in London; this was the perfect opportunity to make the move - and so the wheels were put in motion. I spoke
to work and got the green light to transfer to their london office, and then announced to my closest and dearest friends and family. I don't know what
awaits, but I can truly say that I am ready for the next chapter of this adventure, and I'm excited to share my learnings and experiences in London.
This isn't the last Notts will see of me; I will return to visit regularly. 🫶🏽
