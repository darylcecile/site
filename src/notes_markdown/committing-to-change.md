The past year and a half has been a whirlwind in my career. There were many ups, but towards the end of 2024, I found myself in a bit of a rut. On the one hand, I was proud of the work I had done and the contributions I had made. On the other hand, I felt like I was stuck in a loop, doing the same things over and over, seeing no opportunities come my way. I was in a role that I had outgrown, and while I had learned so much, I felt like I was no longer being challenged. 

I was comfortable, but that comfort was starting to feel like complacency, and in turn I was starting to feel agitated. Furthermore, compounding situations at work made me feel stuck (maybe one for another time, after doing some much needed healing). {/* I felt gaslit into doubting my perception; as though my concerns were unwarranted. */} I was no longer learning, and most importantly no longer able to make the impact I wanted to make. I had lost all sense of fulfilment and my confidence was starting to wane.

In a desperate attempt to regain my footing, I doubled down on <Abbr title="Knosh" link="https://knosh.app">Knosh</Abbr> and poured my energy into building new features, optimising performance, and engaging with the community. I was determined to prove to myself that I could still make a difference—even if it wasn’t in my day job. But as the months went by, I became increasingly [worn out](/notes/burning-bright-without-burning-out). While the project was fulfilling in its own right, it wasn't enough to keep up with the growing feeling of despair. I was missing the thrill of working on complex problems with a team of talented individuals; I missed the camaraderie, the brainstorming sessions, and the shared victories that come from collaborating with others on meaningful tasks. I longed for a place where I could learn from my peers, share my knowledge, and contribute to something bigger than myself.

I’ve always believed in the power of collaboration and the importance of working with others to [create something meaningful](/notes/pf-february-update). That belief has shaped how I approach my work and how I think about the kind of environment I want to be part of—one where shared goals, mutual support, and impact-driven projects are at the core. In fact, this was one of the driving forces behind <Abbr title="ProjectFunction" link="https://projectfunction.io">ProjectFunction</Abbr>, a side project that I started back in 2022 with [Rizwana](https://rizwanakhan.com). It was a way for us to channel our passion for collaboration into something tangible.

### Committing to Change

At the start of this year, I wrote about my [vision for 2025](/notes/when-it-all-falls-into-place-2025) and how I wanted to focus on the things that truly mattered to me; how I wanted to take my career to the next level, explore new opportunities, and step out of my comfort zone; travel more, create content, and share my ideas with the world. I set out to embrace the unknown and take risks that would push me beyond my comfort zone. One evening, after an infuriating day at work, I decided to take a leap of faith and apply for a role that had been on my radar for a while. It was a position that aligned perfectly with my values and aspirations—a chance to work on projects that would have a real impact on the developer experience. As I hit "send", the spark of confidence that ignited me to apply went along with the application. I was terrified. I had no idea if I would even get a response, let alone an interview. This feeling eventually turned into surrender, and I decided to let go of the outcome. I had done my part, and now it was time to see what would happen.

A few weeks later, I received an email inviting me to interview for the position. I was over the moon! The interview process was... fun. Surprisingly, I had a blast. I was able to showcase my skills, share my experiences, and connect with some amazing people along the way. The conversations flowed naturally, and I felt like I was in my element. It was a refreshing change from the previous months of feeling stuck and unfulfilled, plus the people I spoke with were genuinely kind and supportive. I felt like I was being seen for who I truly am. My confidence returned, and with each stage of the process, it grew stronger. By the end of it, I was left with a sense of excitement and anticipation. I could see myself thriving in this new role, contributing to a team that shared my values and passion for making a difference, and the added bonus? The opportunity for me to have a real impact was greater than ever before.

As I tried to contain my excitement, I heard the words I had been hoping for. I was ecstatic! I had taken a leap of faith, and it had paid off. The feeling of being seen, valued, and appreciated was overwhelming. And as further validation, I was being offered a position higher than I had applied for.

With that said, I’m excited to share that I’ve officially earned the coveted <span class="border border-[#0969da] rounded-full px-1.5 py-0.5 text-[#0969da] text-xs whitespace-nowrap leading-4.5 font-[500]">STAFF</span> badge!
I would be joining [Github](https://github.com) as a **Software Engineer III** focusing on Delivery in Developer Experience (DX).

This milestone feels like the culmination of so many threads I’ve been weaving over the years. If you’ve been following my journey, you’ll know that I’ve always been driven by a desire to make a positive impact on not just those around me, but also on myself. Whether it be through my work, inspiring others, or sharing my experiences and understanding of the industry. I’ve always sought opportunities to grow, learn, and contribute meaningfully. The decision to join GitHub wasn’t just about the technical challenges (though there are plenty of those to be excited about!). It was also about aligning with a company whose values resonate deeply with my own. GitHub’s mission to empower developers and foster collaboration across the globe speaks to my core belief in making a positive impact. It’s a place where I can contribute to tools and platforms that help others build amazing things—a ripple effect of impact that I find incredibly inspiring.

As I step into this new chapter, I’m filled with excitement and curiosity. Joining the DX team means I’ll be working on projects that improve the developer experience—a space I’m deeply passionate about. I’m eager to learn from my new teammates, tackle complex problems, and contribute to a platform that has been a cornerstone of my own development journey from the very beginning.

Here’s to new challenges, new perspectives, and making an impact. Let’s do this!

✌🏽
