snippet: Life updates - November
---

So im pulling this from [Carol](https://carol.gg/)'s book an attempt to provide you with a [lifenote](https://twitter.com/carolsaysthings/status/1587174153190268929?s=61&t=jXDDwfGAQLaMRy52o0w4Qg)-esque life update. Since my <Abbr link="https://darylcecile.net/notes/moving-out-notts" title="Moving out">last post</Abbr>, a lot has happened;

- Ive done a couple of house viewings throughout London
- Panther has officially moved down to London
- Ive completed work-related paper work in preparation for the move
- Booked a couple more viewings
- Finalized the [closure of PF](https://web.archive.org/web/20220711151132/https%3A%2F%2Fprojectfunction.io%2Fnotes%2Fthis-isnt-farewell) 🥹
- Started putting together a rough plan for my next side project (Exciting times ahead - Keep an eye out for a post 🤞🏾)
- Panther and [Mastoo](https://twitter.com/rizbizkits/status/1545162625411153923?s=46&t=B1zScKx5_gYSKx0sedQ1-w) have found comfort in each-others company 🖤

Two weeks ago, I found myself in a bit of a rut. The hectic lifestyle i've been trying to keep up with, together with the extremely brutal renting market had led to me spiralling a litte &mdash; and it wast until my manager had brought it up that I had realised that I had not been spending any time on myself. Since then i've been trying to make more time for self-care:

- I started watching Netflix again (My latest watch being <Abbr title="From Scratch" link="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi2yNmljpX7AhWIZ8AKHdlpA4cQFnoECEoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Ftitle%2F81104486&usg=AOvVaw0LrPqvBVfWDOg0KdjX4ww1">From Scratch</Abbr> - which I highly recommend!)
- Treated Will and I to a Spa day at Bannatyne Health Spa in Mansfield
- Made some time to work on the designs for my upcoming side-project
- Signed up to [BeReal](https://bere.al/dcjoa) to see what the hype is all about 👴🏾
- Endulged in a Portobello Mushroom, Ricotta and Garlic brunch at a newly discovered [eatery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VfbxqFcovcLhof3Y6?g_st=ic)

All of this made possible by finding a temporary home for Panther, which allows me to stay down in London for viewings - rather than travelling down every weekend.

Last weekend, Panther and I made our way down to London from Nottingham, and then trekked across the city to [Augustina](https://twitter.com/@AugustukazB) who had kindly offered to house Panther until our housing situation was sorted. The poor boy had a very stressful trip but thankfully he has recovered and and is now enjoying the company of Aira 🖤
