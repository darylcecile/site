snippet: I'm looking for my next challenge!

So it's been officially 3 years and 8 months (give or take) since I last wrote Futuristic <Abbr title="Futuristic Pursuit" link="https://darylcecile.net/notes/futuristic-pursuit">Pursuit</Abbr>. How time flies!

Since then, I got a job at Capital One UK; starting off as a Software Engineer and quickly progressing to a Senior Role, I finalized the winding-down of ProjectFunction, <Abbr title="Moving out" link="https://darylcecile.net/notes/moving-out-notts">Moved to London</Abbr> with Panther and my Partner, and got back into working on my side projects (after recovering from some serious burnout!)

### Time for change

Due to some recent changes in the engineering department structure and future direction, I decided it was time for me to find my next new challenge; to go out forth and figure out whats next in my career journey. Let me tell you, the market is brutal at the moment. Here are the numbers to date:

- 2 interviews at exciting companies
- 4 interviews at companies that ended up throwing too many red flags
- 1 interview at a company based in Germany
- 3 pending interviews

Initially I was struggling to get interviews, but more recently I've had an influx of invites and interviews come through on both my LinkedIn and <Abbr title="Otta Jobs" link="https://otta.com">Otta</Abbr>, so I am hopeful.

With an aim to follow traditions (and in true Daryl-fashion), here is a rough idea of what im looking for next:

- A <s>startup-like</s> 'Big-corp' environment would be perfect
- An internal tooling role (Web)
- Team where Node.js + Typescript are part of their toolset (or looking to adopt)
- Flexible working (No office-only)
- Having personal-development budget and opportunities
- No crunch-time (clear seperation of work and personal life)
- Regular opportunities for career-progression
- Stellar SEM known internally for their supportive and enabling nature
- Diverse and inclusive teams
- Actively pursues experimentation and Proof-of-concept
- A place that is not afraid to make (and dogfood) their own tools
- Open-souce contributors would be a plus
- A place that is happy to work and give back to the community

All in all, I have a clear idea of the kind of workplace where I want to work as a Senior Software Engineer 👨🏽‍💻. Now we need to make it happen 🚀
