Every once in a while, I like to scroll through social media profiles to look at people's websites. It's a habit I picked up from years ago when personal websites were more common, and I find it fascinating to see how people present themselves online outside of the constraints of social media platforms. And for a while, I've been wanting to add a list of interesting websites I've found to my own site. So I decided to start compiling a list, starting with ones that [@rizwana](https://rizwanakhan.com/) and I have exchanged over the past year.

As I was digging through some of these sites, I stumbled upon something unexpected: <Abbr link="https://indieweb.org/webring" title="webring">webring</Abbr>. For those who might not be familiar, webrings were a (somewhat) popular way in the early days of the internet for websites with similar themes or interests to link to each other in a circular fashion. It was a way to create a sense of community and help users discover related content before search engines became as powerful as they are today.

After some clicking around, I found myself on the [Bucket webring](https://webring.bucketfish.me/) where I discovered a treasure trove of personal websites, blogs, and creative projects. It was like stepping back in time to an era when the internet felt more like a collection of individual voices rather than a few dominant platforms. The designs were eclectic, the content was diverse, and there was a palpable sense of authenticity that I hadn't felt in a long time. It reminded me of myspace days, but without the noise of ads and endless notifications, and when Tumblr was still a thing.

Continuing through the webring, I landed on pages about pixel art, cassette-tape collections, obscure hobbies, odd little blogs. I saw people sharing stuff for no reason other than the fact they wanted to share. The layouts might have been messy. The designs rough. But it felt honest. Real. It was a refreshing change from the homogenized look and feel of many modern websites. Some (like [HML](https://hml.nekoweb.org/)) even embraced the retro aesthetic of the early web, complete with animated GIFs.

And others like [itsvaeav](https://itsvaeav.nekoweb.org/) were more simple but still playful.

You even had some that looked more modern, but still with a retro vibe, like [qswitch](https://qswitch.neocities.org/).

For a while now, I've been feeling a bit disillusioned with the modern internet. Social media algorithms, endless ads, and the constant chase for virality have made it hard to find genuine connections and quality (and low-quality) content. So, I decided to take a step back and explore some of the older corners of the web, and what I found was surprisingly refreshing. The webring reminded me of a time when the internet was more about individual expression and less about metrics and engagement. It was a reminder that the web can still be a place for creativity, community, and genuine connection.

Off the back of this, I've added a [/bookmarks](/bookmarks) page to my site where I'll be keeping a list of interesting websites I come across. I've also added my website to the IndieWeb webring and open-sourced it on [GitHub](https://github.com/darylcecile/site).

If you're interested in exploring some of these hidden gems, I highly recommend checking out the Bucket webring and seeing where it takes you. You never know what you might discover.

Until next time… ✌🏽🐡🌟
