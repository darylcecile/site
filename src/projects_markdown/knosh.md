Knosh is a socially-driven restaurant discovery app designed to make dining out inclusive, effortless, and fun. It helps users find and organise meals with friends based on everyone’s dietary needs—whether allergies, intolerances, or lifestyle preferences. By combining personalised recommendations, verified allergen data, and group planning tools, Knosh empowers people to enjoy shared dining experiences without compromise. It's not just about eating out—it’s about making everyone feel welcome at the table.

Built on <Abbr title="React Native" link="https://reactnative.dev">React Native</Abbr> using <Abbr title="Expo" link="https://expo.dev" faviconUrl="https://static.expo.dev/static/favicons/favicon-dark-48x48.png">Expo</Abbr> to target both Android and iOS, Knosh delivers a cross-platform experience backed by a scalable  architecture. It integrates language models from OpenAI and Anthropic to generate personalised summaries and surface relevant dining options, while real-time allergen matching ensures safe group recommendations based on multiple user profiles. The platform also features a dedicated restaurant portal for businesses to manage allergen data and run targeted campaigns, creating a feedback loop that benefits both users and businesses.

This project is a personal passion of mine, and I’m excited to share it with the world. Knosh is currently in beta, and I’m looking for early adopters to help shape its future. If you’re interested in joining the beta program, please reach out!
