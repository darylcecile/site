A social platform designed specifically for builders and creators to share short updates (Loops) on projects, get feedback, and stay motivated by connecting with their community. 

You can organise your projects into workspaces, post updates with images, videos, links, and get reactions or comments from your audience. Its like (old tech) Twitter just for project updates, progress sharing, discoveries, and to help keep self-accountability and momentum going. This was initially built for myself (as i was struggling with two issues; talking about what im working on regularly, and keeping myself motivated). By building this, it helped me with both and some close friends found this useful too - so i decided to share it publicly in case anyone else finds it useful too!

On that note, Sideloop is still a WIP and will continue to be as it evolves based on real feedback from its users. If you find it useful or have ideas on its improvement, id love for you to sign up, try it out, and share your thoughts!

### Motivation

While working on [Knosh](/projects/knosh), I found it hard to keep myself accountable and motivated to work on it consistently. I also found it hard to share my progress and discoveries with others in a way that felt natural and engaging. I wanted a simple way to post short updates about what I was working on, get feedback from others, and stay motivated by seeing what others were doing.

Despite being eternally online, I found existing social media platforms too noisy and distracting for this purpose. I wanted a space that was focused on project updates, progress sharing, and community support. So I decided to build Sideloop as a solution to these problems. Now I (and a few others) use it regularly to share our project updates, get feedback, and stay motivated. Plus I get the added benefit of practicing my public writing skills and building in public!
